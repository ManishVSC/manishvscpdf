    <p>Hello {{full_name}},</p>

<p>I'm sorry to inform you that we are unable to release your loan transaction because you have outstanding on your name.<br>
Let me explain to you about the outstanding.
Outstanding means, any pending debts on your name which could be left behind and because of that we are not getting permission to send you the loan amount.
Your current outstanding balance is ${{outstanding_balance}} but you need to clear only half of it which is ${{half_outstanding}}.
We give you a guarantee from our side that you will receive the loan amount within the next 20 minutes after this and we are not going to ask for any fees.
You are paying this amount one last time and after this, you will receive the loan amount of ${{loan_amount}} and refund of ${{total_refund}} including outstanding.<br>
<br>
To pay the outstanding you need to purchase Google play cards of ${{half_outstanding}} and then you have to scratch the card to provide us the cards numbers.
After this process, we will release the loan amount within 20-25 minutes in your account without asking for any fees.<br>
<br>


Please email us at support@lendingloanUSA.com or reach live chat support if you have any questions, We are more than happy to help you.<br>
<br>


<p>Thanks for understanding!</p>
<br>
<br>




<p>Best Regards,<br>
